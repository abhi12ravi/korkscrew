A ethereum based decentralized application for end to end quality assurance of products

**NOTE** The wallet is in prototype stage.


# Motivation
The unique nature of single malt whiskey is that only one grain (barley) is used, and so the word “single” can be used to describe the malt whiskey. Moreover, it is a product of one single distillery. If you took a single malt whiskey from Distillery A and mixed it with Distillery B, you no longer have a single malt whiskey. 

Since the purity of alcohol depends on the location of the distillery and the fact that every bottle in a shipment has to originate from one single location – blockchain offers a unique solution for tracking these bottles from the distillery where they get manufactured to the alcohol shops where they are sold and the restaurants where they are served.  Throughout the supply chain, the distributed ledger can be made use of to track the bottles in a decentralized fashion. This will ensure that the quality of the whiskey is not compromised along the supply chain. 

# Vision

We have taken up the quality assurance of whiskey as a proof of concept. The solution can be scaled and deployed to other essential commodities like distilled water, food grains, etc where “quality” plays a major role.
